# Feedback app
This project is mostly copied from the course ['React Front to Back 2022'](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/). The design is very stylish and this project was more useful to learn react hooks and component organization. I do not want to reinvent the wheel too much here and so only a few minor bug fixes and some personalization were made!
